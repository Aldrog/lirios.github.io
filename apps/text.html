             Writing code is without any doubt a fantastic way to contribute
             to the development of the project.
             Liri Text is written using <a href="https://qt.io">Qt</a> (C++) for app logics and QtQuick (QML, JavaScript) for UI.
             We use QtQuick Controls 2 and <a href="https://github.com/lirios/fluid">Fluid</a> to create our Material Design based user interface.
